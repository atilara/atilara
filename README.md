My name is **Átila Rodrigues**, and I'm currently studying **Computer Science** at **Federal Rural University of Pernambuco (UFRPE)** and working at **Cesar** as a **Jr Software Engineer**.

I'm a fullstack developer with experience in Next.js and NodeJS using TypeScript, also Django using Python. 

My journey with technology began at the Miguel Batista State Technical School, where I studied systems development as a technician.

I am skilled at working with others, able to communicate effectively, and practical when it comes to assessing my abilities and what I can accomplish.
